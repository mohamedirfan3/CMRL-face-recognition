# CMRL-face-recognition
This project was done in my internship for Chennai metro rail limited under Mr.Sivakumar
Objective for Face Recognition Project: Develop a face recognition system using a combination
of machine learning and image processing techniques. The project leverages the K-Nearest Neighbors
(KNN) algorithm through Sklearn.neighbors for face classification, and utilizes cv2 for OpenCV
functionalities. It also incorporates libraries like Numpy for data manipulation, Os for system interactions, Csv for data handling, Datetime for timestamp management, Win32com.client for component object
interaction, Pickle for serialization, Subprocess for managing external processes, and Tkinter for creating
a graphical user interface.
